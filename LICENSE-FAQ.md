# License FAQ

> **DRAFT - pending legal review. Do not publish.**

This FAQ applies to Sylius Live One Page Checkout Plugin (`sylius/live-one-page-checkout-plugin`)
version **[VERSION]** and is shipped unchanged with that release. It only explains the
[LICENSE](LICENSE); it does not add or change any obligation. If this FAQ and the LICENSE
conflict, the LICENSE prevails.

## Which license applies?

The plugin is released under the Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL-1.1). It is source-available,
not open source. Each version converts to the MIT license four years after it is published.

Sylius core and its libraries remain under the MIT license. BUSL-1.1 applies to this plugin only.

## What can I do without a commercial license?

Regardless of telemetry, you may always:

- copy, modify and create derivative works of the plugin,
- redistribute it,
- use it in development, testing, staging and demonstration environments.

You may also use it in production for free, provided that:

- you do not deliberately disable, remove, block or modify the telemetry functionality so as to
  prevent it from operating as documented, and
- you do not use the plugin to provide a competing offering.

## What is production use?

Running the plugin in an online store that is available to its customers. Development, testing,
staging and demonstration environments are non-production use.

## What does telemetry require?

The free production use requires Sylius **2.2 or later**, with the Sylius telemetry feature and the
`sylius/telemetry` integration required by the plugin. Telemetry is described in
[TELEMETRY DOCUMENTATION LINK, frozen for this release].

Temporary technical failures, such as a network outage or an unavailable Sylius endpoint, do not
breach the condition. Only a deliberate action that stops telemetry from working does.

## What happens if I disable telemetry in production?

The shop keeps working, but production use without telemetry falls outside the free license.
Under BUSL-1.1, use in violation of the license terminates your rights under it, for this and all
other versions of the plugin, including non-production use.

You then need to either restore telemetry or purchase a commercial license. Sylius has published a
[licensor statement](LICENSOR-STATEMENT.md) giving you 30 days from notice to do so before it
enforces the termination.

Setting `SYLIUS_TELEMETRY_ENABLED=0` in Sylius core is such a deliberate action.

## What is a competing offering?

A paid product or service, offered to third parties, that copies, embeds or hosts the plugin or a
substantial portion of it, and that provides functionality substantially similar to the plugin.

You remain free to build and sell your own checkout solution independently, without using the
plugin's code.

## I am an agency. Can I implement the plugin for my clients?

Yes. Implementation, customization, maintenance and support services provided to a store that uses
the plugin are not a competing offering.

## Who can sell me a commercial license?

[LIST OF AUTHORIZED ENTITIES: Sylius sp. z o.o. and named affiliates or resellers]

## Does this affect One Page Checkout for Sylius 1.x?

No. The Sylius 1.x One Page Checkout plugin is a different package and stays under its existing
license and contracts.
